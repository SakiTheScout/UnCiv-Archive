Usual dialogue was no more here: only one person spoke. 'Gehenna Academy has always loomed over us like a shadow, a beast leaving its cave to bring destruction.' She spoke. 'We stood together for centuries, but our defences are clumbling slowly but surely. We cannot ensure safety of our schools anymore.' Words silenced all whispers for a brief moment. Everyone was tense. Then, the hall was filled with hushed words of delegates talking and thinking of the implications brought by this declaration. 'Silence!' Someone said. 'What do you suggest then?' The first speaker smiled at this question. 'We propose the solution. We erase our borders, melt together into one, strong school that will rival Gehenna Academy. I called this the Trinity Treaty.' People gasped. Whispers rose anew. Unification? Into one school? All schools here were sovereign, independent and self-sufficient. Unification was unthinkable. 'Who do you think you are?! I see what your true colors are, you hope to seize more control and power!' Yelled someone in accusation. Debates bursted with new force, like a wildfire. Honourable guards of Knights Hospitaller tightened grips on their ceremonial weaponry. 'Silence! Silence! Silence!' Yelled the speaker. 'Your accusations are empty! I only seek prosperity of everyone here! Look through the terms, all schools will be represented by separate autonomous clubs with own holds and resources, you don't have to give anything up! Give it a second thought, please!' After that, the delegates started reviewing the Treaty. Trinity Gemeral School... This name was fresh and attractive. All schools as clubs, autonomous but unite closer than ever. Democracy, balance of power, better oversight and organisation. But Arius will not be tempted. 'We reject. Better or not, Arius Branch will remain sovereign. I hope that even if you will sign this treaty, we will all remain friends.' Delegates from Arius left the hall of Tea Party under heavy side glances of other presidents.",

By the third dusk, Arius District laid in ruins, the downpour kept going and going, like the Great Flood was sent by skies to wash off the sins. On fifth day, survivors, scattered and scared, came from the ruins of their homes, cold and hungry. On seventh day, General Student Council declared Arius Branch School extinct. Raiders started to flood Arius, eager to tear apart the remnants of the institution.",

Madame ruled with iron fist, all hope, all faith and all traditions were discarded. 'Vanitas Vanitatum et Omnia Vanitas'. This is how motto of New Arius sounded.
