I see what your true colors are, you hope to seize more control and power!' Yelled someone in accusation. Debates bursted with new force, like a wildfire. Honourable guards of Knights Hospitaller tightened grips on their ceremonial weaponry. 'Silence! Silence! Silence!' Yelled the speaker. 'Your accusations are empty! I only seek prosperity of everyone here! Look through the terms, all schools will be represented by separate autonomous clubs with own holds and resources, you don't have to give anything up! Give it a second thought, please!' After that, the delegates started reviewing the Treaty. Trinity Gemeral School... This name was fresh and attractive. All schools as clubs, autonomous but unite closer than ever. Democracy, balance of power, better oversight and organisation. But Arius will not be tempted. 'We reject. Better or not, Arius Branch will remain sovereign. I hope that even if you will sign this treaty, we will all remain friends.' Delegates from Arius left the hall of Tea Party under heavy side glances of other presidents.",

To arms!' So began the battle for Arius. Unthinkable, despicable atrocity of newborn Trinity General School, born in blood of slain friends. By the third dusk, Arius laid in ruins and desolation. Crucified civilians stared emptily at the downpour that kept going and going, like the Gread Flood was sent by skies to wash off the sins. On fifth day, survivors, scattered and scared, came from the ruins of their homes, cold and hungry. On seventh day, General Student Council declared Arius Branch School extinct. Raiders started to flood Arius, eager to tear apart the remnants of the institution.",
